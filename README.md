# Credit-Card-fraud-detection
Credit Card Fraud Detection Project
Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that detects fraudulent credit card transactions. By analyzing patterns in transaction data, the model identifies anomalies indicative of fraud, helping financial institutions minimize losses and improve security.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles imbalanced datasets using techniques like SMOTE, undersampling, or oversampling.
Feature Engineering: Scales numerical features, removes outliers, and selects important predictors.
Model Training: Utilizes machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks.
Model Evaluation: Assesses performance using metrics like Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC-AUC.
Dataset
The project uses the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset.

Number of Transactions: 284,807
Fraudulent Transactions: 492 (~0.172%)
Features:
Time and Amount: Transaction time and amount.
V1â€“V28: Anonymized features obtained through PCA.
Class: Target variable (0 = Non-fraudulent, 1 = Fraudulent).
